# Random-Hamiltonian-Simulation

A Qiskit Implementation of the QDrift Algorithm proposed by Campbell [A Random Compilter for Fast Hamiltonian Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.08017)

## Usage
### Run one run of the experiment 
```
python test.py
```

### Create a plot of QDrift performance against number of repetitions
```
python eval_performance.py
```
